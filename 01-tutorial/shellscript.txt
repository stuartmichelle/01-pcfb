Make a directory to hold scripts

mkdir scripts

echo $PATH  - to see current list of locations where scripts can be reached

Add your new scripts directory to path if it isn't already there in .bash_profile

export PATH=$PATH:/Users/MacBook/01-pcfb/01-tutorial/scripts

Make a new script called dir.sh

give it permissions - from the scripts directory

chmod u+x dir.sh
